What Are the Basic Assumption\n","There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model:\n","\n","1. Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.\n","2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X. Residual = actual y value âˆ’ predicted y value\n","3. Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n","4. Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed. If its not normally correlated, use log transformation etc for normalization. Scaling of data is very important."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WBKfDDMD5ZBZ"},"source":["#####  2. Advantages\n","1. Linear regression performs exceptionally well for linearly separable data\n","2. Easy to implement and train the model\n","3.

Impact of outliers?\n","linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MRH01bVu5ZBa"},"source":["##### Different Problem statement you can solve using Linear Regression\n","1.
